# ElabFTW
Extending the features of ElabFTW

# The main tasks of this extension:
1- Converting the experiment table to a JSON in order to ingest it to other platforms using API.
2- Migrating the data to SMW and return a reference link to the generated resource/Experiment on SMW to be linked to the experiment page on ElabFTW.

# User Experience
1- A user click on (convert to JSON) button on ElabFTW experiment page.
2- Experiment's table is converted to JSON and sent to SMW API.
3- The table will be locked for editing after cliking on the button unless the researcher unloacked it again.
4- The researcher can go to the SMW reference using the return link from SMW.
